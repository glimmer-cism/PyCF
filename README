PyCF is a collection of python modules and programs which can be used to
manipulate glimmer CF data.

Installation
You will need the following packages
* GMT       http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/
* proj4     http://proj.maptools.org/
* Numeric   http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/
* Scientific Python 
            http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/
* PyGMT     https://forge.nesc.ac.uk/projects/pygmt/

If your proj4 library is not in a standard location than you need to set
the environment variable PROJ_PREFIX to point to the location where proj4
is installed. You should install PyCF into the GLIMMER_PREFIX, i.e.
./setup.py install --home=$GLIMMER_PREFIX
since some modules query GLIMMER_PREFIX to find data files.

Programs
* create_topo.py - create input topo file
